Rotation Groups

A rotation group for a string contains all of its unique rotations. For example, "123" can be rotated to "231" and "312" and they are all in the same rotation group.

Given a list of strings words, group each word by their rotation group, and return the total number of groups.


Constraints

    n â‰¤ 200 where n is the length of words.

Example 1
Input

words = ["abc", "xy", "yx", "z", "bca"]

Output

3

Explanation

There are three rotation groups:

    ["abc", "bca"]
    ["xy", "yx"]
    ["z"]
